This is a Discord bot which keeps track of who buzzed in, as well as each player's score.

## Usage

!pairChannels #packet-text-channel Voice-Channel-Name

### Instructions:
- If you want to be the reader, type in !read
- Read questions. Buzz in with "buzz", or near equivalents like "bzz", "buzzzz", etc.
  - If a player needs to withdraw their buzz, type in "wd"
- When someone buzzes in, give them a score (-5, 0, 10, 15, 20). If the person gets the question wrong, the next person in the queue will be prompted.
  - If no one got the question correct, type in !next
  - If the current question is in a bad state and you need to clear all answers and the queue, type in !clear
  - If you are playing with bonuses, score them with splits (like 10/0/10) or binary (101).
- You can type !score to get the current scores
- If the reader needs to undo their last scoring action, use !undo
- If you want to change readers, use !setnewreader @NewReadersMention
